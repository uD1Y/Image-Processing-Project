# Image Cryptography Based on Simple Image Cryptography

## Running 

1. To encrypt an image, give the name of the image in the file and then run it.
2. Give a key number.

3. To decrypt the image, give the name of the image in the file and then run it.
And Then enter the key value. 
The image can be found decrypted.

## Example

1. Run the encryption program to encrypt the image ```naruto.png```
      
      Use ```python Encryption.py```

2. Run the decrpytion program to decrypt the image, run and enter the key value
      
      Use ```python Decryption.py```

The encrpyted image will be decrypted and we can see the original image.
